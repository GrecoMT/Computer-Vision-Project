# Computer Vision Project
This repository contains a computer vision project aimed at detecting a soccer ball in videos of football matches provided for this study. The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically YOLOv11, to build a reliable object detection model capable of identifying soccer balls under various conditions.

## Key Features:

- Data preprocessing, including data augmentation for enhanced model performance.
- Model training using YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art object detection architecture.
- Post-processing pipeline for refining detetion outputs.
